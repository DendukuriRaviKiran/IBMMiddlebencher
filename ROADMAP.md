## Middlebencher currently:

* Gathers orders from sample houses from mobile application sends that data to the IBM Cloud for processing
* Processes the transaction via MQTT and performs water transfer between sample communities
* Stores data collected by ultrasonic sensor for long-term analysis of better water usage prediction
* Visualizes data through a dashboard 

## Within the next months we are aiming to do:

- [ ] Monitor more data with additional sensors 
- [ ] Explore hardware options to improve performance and range
- [ ] Create more capability in the dashboard

## Longer term goals are:

- [ ] Wider rollout of Middlebencher solutions to communities all over the world
- [ ] Explore options for edge processing (offline first, centralized device configuration)
